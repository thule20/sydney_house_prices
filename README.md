## EDA WITH PYTHON PROJECT

### Topic: A general view of Greater Sydney house market over 5 years (2018 - 2023)

**INTRODUCTION**

In this analysis, we will provide insights into Sydney's property rent and sales trends over a 5-year period, including the Covid period from 2020 to 2021. This information is beneficial for individuals who are new to the Sydney market and are curious about how Sydney house prices have changed over time. We will explore whether they should buy a house in busy or rural areas and assess if their current weekly rent is high or low compared to others.

**DATASETS**

We used source datasets from Family and Community Services (FACS) under NSW Department of Communities and Justice, including:

- Quarterly reports of house sales number & sales prices by LGAs from Mar 2018 to Jun 2023, sourced at: https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/resources/statistics/rent-and-sales
- Quarterly reports of weekly rent, new lodge rental bonds and total live rental bonds by LGAs from Mar 2018 to Jun 2023, sourced at: https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/resources/statistics/rent-and-sales

They are stored in many folders under **sydney_house_prices/house_prices**, with each folder containing sales and rental data for one year. If you want to launch my coding source, remember to structure the data folder to ensure the code can find the right file path.
